        <p>
            BrewQueue’s user-friendly interface allows customers to easily select a bar and secure a
            spot in a virtual line. The app provides real-time updates on wait times and sends notifications
            to users 15 minutes before their estimated arrival. With options to extend their wait time or withdraw
            with a partial refund, BrewQueue prioritizes user convenience and flexibility.
